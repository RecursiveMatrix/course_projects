# Flappy Bird Game
This ia a python-based project for implementation of the classic flappy bird game using pygame package.
# Overview
In the game, the user will control the vertical velocity of the bird
through keyboard or mouse button to make sure that the bird passes through the gaps
between pipes. Each time the bird passes through the gap without hitting on either of
pipe, the user will gain one point for that. The total points will be recorded as an
evaluation of the game playing.
